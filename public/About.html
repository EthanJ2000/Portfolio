  <h1 id="aboutheading">Biography</h1> 
  <p class="bioparagraph">My name is Ethan Jansen, I'm 19 and currently interning at
  <a href="https://www.younglings.capetown/" class="younglinglink" target="blank_" >Younglings Africa</a>. 
  When I was only 1 year old, my family and I moved to Asia. Specifically, to Taiwan. By the time I 
  started grade 2, we had moved again. This time to Hong Kong. This is where I feel like I developed my work
  ethic. Fast forward to grade 10, my family and I had moved back to Cape Town. Which was scary for a while.
  I didn't know anyone, and I didn't speak a word of Afrikaans. This, however, turned out to be a blessing.
  My lack of Afrikaans knowledge granted me an exemption from taking the language, which gave me the opportunity
  to take another subject. Now even though my high school didn't offer it, I decided to take IT. Which is ultimately
  what led me to discover the learnership program which I am currently on, and what led me to discover Younglings,
  which is where I am currently interning.

  <h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
  <p class="bioparagraph">Over the years, I've tried my hand at many different things. Ranging from mild 
    interest to full-blown obsessions. These days however, my interests include: Reading, Gaming, Coding,
    Puzzles etc.
